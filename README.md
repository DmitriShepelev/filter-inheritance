## Task description ##

> Analyze solutions Filter by digit task and Filter by palindromic task  in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute (predicate)?   
  - Using the capabilities of inheritance, propose the option of allocating reusable code. Do not use LINQ and delegates.   
  - Add XML-comments to public members of the solution.  
  - Demonstrate the possibility of using common code with two different predicate of the number (see task conditions above) using them when developing tests.   
  - Get to know about moq-tests.
