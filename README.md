## Task description ##

- Analyze solutions [Filter by digit task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/int-array-filter) and [Filter by palindromic task](https://gitlab.com/epam-autocode-tasks/filter-by-palindromic)  in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute (predicate)?   
- Using the capabilities of inheritance, propose the option of allocating reusable code.   
- Add XML-comments to public members of the solution.  
- Demonstrate the possibility of using common code with two different predicate of the number (see task conditions above) using them when developing tests.   
- Get to know about  [moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart)-tests.
