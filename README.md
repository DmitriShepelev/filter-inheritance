## Task description ##

> Analyze solutions `Filter by digit task` (Filter elements. Task #25) and `Filter by palindromic task` (Filter by Palindromic. Task #31) in terms of code common to them. What part of the code can be made reusable, and which part is customizable, depending on the specific way of matching the number with a certain attribute (predicate)?   
- Using the capabilities of inheritance, propose the option of allocating reusable code.      
- Demonstrate the possibility of using common code with two different predicate of the number. Place solutions in two separate projects:
    - [Filter by digit](FilerByDigit/);
    - [Filter by palindromic](FilterByPalindromic/).
- Get to know about  [moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart)-tests.
